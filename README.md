# Saved Games

* Safety net
* Hidden Value: Allows for experimentation

# Writing Code

# Example of pre source control setup

* copying your sourcefile or directory and making duplicates

# Why I don't do this

* hard to imediately tell what's been changed
* not very cost efficient
* hard to effectively collaborate

# What I do do (hehehe)

* Use Git!

# Initialize

# Create a new commit

* Like saving a game

# Build or experinemnt

* branches
* revert to save state

# Branches

# Collaboration

# How people hire based off of github profiles

* have they done dev in language we are using
* README
* quality of the code (legible, testable, flexible, compliant with requirements, economical)
  * vars/classes/methods are thoughtfully named to reveal intent
  * progression of skill

* they care
* they can finish something
  * showing a 'finished' project somehow (ie - is it on heroku)
  * real world solution a plus
* their "default" output is professional

* recent activity
* contributions
* passion
* working knowledge

* similar to having a blog
* just having a profile puts you ahead (it shows you know how to use git ;))
